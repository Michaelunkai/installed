	<SteamRunning title="Warning:" width="450" height="200">GameSave Manager has detected that Steam is currently running on your machine.

While GameSave Manager doesn't interact with Steam directly, it does move game files (within the directory specified).
As such, Steam can sometimes detect these files as 'missing' and proceed to start downloading them.

Continue anyway?</SteamRunning>
