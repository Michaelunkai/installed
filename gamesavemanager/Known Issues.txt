==================================
|| GameSave Manager 3.x		||
||		Known Issues	||
==================================

Issue 1:
--------

While a lot of changes have been made to GameSave Manager since v2, UAC (User Account Control) can still cause issues.
It's therefore recommended that you disable it where possible.

Issue 2:
--------

Backup Archives created with the 'first generation' of GameSave Manager (i.e v1.x) aren't compatible with v3.

Please note that you can still download the last v1.x release made from our Download section - http://www.gamesave-manager.com/?s=download&t=archive

Issue 3:
--------

As the Backup Archive structure has altered, backups made with v2.x releases will not be 'read' correctly when performing a backup.
As such, all older backups will be seen as containing out-dated files to the ones currently on your system. This will cause GameSave Manager to re-create those archives in the v3.x format.

Issue 4:
--------

Due to a limitation in the language GameSave Manager is coded in (i.e LUA), some languages cannot be fully supported (such as Russian).
Having said this, we've made some progress on the subject. More information can be found here: http://www.gamesave-manager.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=1400
